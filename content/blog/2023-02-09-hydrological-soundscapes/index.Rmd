The seasonality of flows in a river is an important part of its identity. Many studies start by displaying a chart similar to the one below to identify high-flow and low-flow seasons at a glance. In a previous post, we already illustrated how these charts could be sonified to explore [hydrologic regimes in Australia](/blog/australian-river-cruises). This post goes one step further by introducing [Hydrological Soundspace](https://hydrologicalsoundscapes.github.io/), an interactive web app developped by [ihdev](https://www.ihdev.fr/en) to explore hydrologic regimes all over the world in an interactive way.

# World Music, by Rivers

The video below shows a demo of [Hydrological Soundspace](https://hydrologicalsoundscapes.github.io/). Hydrometric stations measuring river flow can be selected by a clic on the map, and the chart panel on the left shows the seasonality of flows (top), but also of floods (middle) and droughts (bottom). Each chart controls a distinct musical instrument, and the tempo is inversely proportional to the average flow. Each river therefore creates its own song that can be interpreted as a kind of musical ID. The web app also allows experimenting with various options such as the musical scale used to create the melody, the rhythmic pattern, etc.

# Insights

As a general rule, nearby stations tend to sound similar, while large geographical jumps make a larger musical difference. However, there are exceptions to this rule, in particular in mountainous areas. Cold vs. warm regions.

Interesting questions such as: should floods be associated with high or low pitches? should small rivers sound slow or fast?
