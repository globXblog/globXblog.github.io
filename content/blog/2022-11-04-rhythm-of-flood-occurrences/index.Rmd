# Let's do the maths

It is actually fairly easy to work out the maths hiding behind this plot. 

Let's assume there was a 10-year flood last year, and let's count the number of years before we see another one (or worse).

Waiting only one year means that the flood occurs on the first year, and as explained above this has probability 0.1.

Waiting 2 years means that there is no occurrence on year 1 (this has probability 0.9), but there is one on year 2 (probability 0.1). The probability of having this particular sequence (no occurrence, then occurrence) is 0.9\*0.1=0.09. 

Waiting 3 years means that there is no occurrence on year 1 (probability 0.9), no occurrence on year 2 (probability 0.9) but there is one on year 3 (probability 0.1). This gives 0.9\*0.9\*0.1=0.9<sup>2</sup>\*0.1=0.081.

An so one and so forth... waiting 4 years gives 0.9<sup>3</sup>\*0.1, waiting *k* years gives 0.9<sup>*k*-1</sup>\*0.1
