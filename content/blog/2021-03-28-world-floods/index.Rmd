The [Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata Archive](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.887470) describes hydrological regimes all over the World. A subset of around 2000 stations over the period 1903-2016 is used in the [HEGS project](/hegs/) to study floods at the global scale. In order to get a quick overview of this large dataset, the [flood occurrences interactive map](https://globxblog.shinyapps.io/worldFloods/) shows, for each station, the largest flood for a given season of a given year:

* circle **size** is proportional to the flood severity, expressed as a return period (eg 50-year flood, [100-year flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100-year_flood), â€¦).
* circle **color** indicates whether the flood is larger than a given threshold.

Seasons refer to those in the Northern Hemisphere; for example Winter is December-January-February.

Using the date selector, some notable large-scale floods appear on the map: [Winter 1964](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/NewsBlog/archives/2019/12/26/from-the-journal-archives-when-the-water-rose-in-1964) in Western US, [Winter 1995](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/special_summaries/96_1/) in North America or [Winter 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_European_floods) in Europe are just a few of them.
