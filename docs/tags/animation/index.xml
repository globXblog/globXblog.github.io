      <description>The seasonality of flows in a river is an important part of its identity. Many studies start by displaying a chart similar to the one below to identify high-flow and low-flow seasons at a glance.</description>

      <description>“This was a 100-year event”.
This type of sentence is often heard in the news after a flood or a storm hits somewhere, as it does a good job at carrying the rarity of what happened.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, we illustrated a widely used method called principal component analysis (PCA). This method can be used as an exploratory tool to summarise a dataset made of hundreds or thousands of time series into just a few ‘summary’ time series called principal components.</description>

      <description>In hydrology, it is frequent to analyse long time series coming from many sites. The figure below shows monthly streamflows at 207 sites in France for the period 1969-2014.</description>

      <description>In the fun with dendrograms post, a linear dendrogram is gradually bent into a full circle. This transformation isn’t specific to dendrograms and can be applied to any dataset.</description>

      <description>The globXblog logo is a colourful doughnut that mimics an equaliser, referring to the sonification and visualisation part of the blog. In its core, a stormy icon represents the hydrological part of the blog.</description>

      <description>How does water end up flowing in rivers? As schematized below, it is the result of processes that have taken place in the river basin, also known as a catchment and delineated by a red line in the figure.</description>

      <description>A dendrogram is a way to visualise objects organised in a hierarchy. It looks like a tree where:
the leaves represent the objects of the dataset; the branches link similar leaves according to a given criterion.</description>

      <title>How Australian rivers can be grouped into 4 main hydrologic regimes</title>

      <description>Investigating the hydrologic regime of 195 rivers in Australia revealed three types of flow seasonality. At some stations, the wettest period occurs during one particular season (winter or summer), whereas at others, similar flows are observed all year round.</description>

      <description>Plotting hydrologic regimes Most hydrologic studies start by determining the average quantity of water in rivers and how it is distributed throughout the year.</description>
